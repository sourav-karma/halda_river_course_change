# halda_river_course_change

Bangladesh is considered the largest delta formed by sediments carried by its very active river system consisting of hundreds of rivers. Erosion and accretion are severe due to the dynamic nature of river system. Measuring erosion and accretion by site inspection or satellite imagery is cumbersome and time consuming. 

We took Halda, as a case to identify erosion and accretion site and quantify how much changes has occurred between 1984 to 2015 from Global Surface Water database developed by European Joint River Commission. Halda is a very important river due to its role as the spawning ground for major Indian carps. Anthropogenic activities accelerate river course change which can hinders significant aspect of Halda river. 

An effective combination of Google Earth Engine, Google Earth, Land use and NDWI water classes give us the clear idea how Halda river as well as its basin changes over time and helps to identify the most vulnerable sites. 

Google earth engine generates the surface water map layer considering changes over Halda river in 32 years of study period and divides it into many transition classes. From those classes new permanent and new seasonal water body denotes the total land undergone to river within this period which is 118 ha. While lost permanent and lost seasonal water helps to measure the accreted land area which is 163.02 ha. Water change intensity map shows the region where 100% water gained and lost over the periods by which river course change was observed. 

To measure the recent trend of river course change, I considered three parameters: length, width, bends by drawing a middle line of river for 2001, 2009 and 2018 in google earth. 

Results have shown that, the river course is continuously changing due to erosion and accretion at river bank. Land use and Land cover class along with NDWI for starting and ending periods of database was calculated to capture the amount of water body at Halda basin, both observed a decreasing trend of water body, 0.3% and 0.11% lost respectively. 

There is scope to improve this study by improving database and analytical algorithm as well as by using higher resolution images. This research will contribute to take protective measures by the authority at specific vulnerable sites identified. The research indicated increasing sedimentation of Halda which could be linked to the loss of vegetation in the Halda basin and immediate measures should be taken to afforest the entire basin quickly. Anyone can apply this approach to other big rivers in Bangladesh to estimate erosion and accretion.
